Using any hack carries inherent risks, but smart play and proper setup significantly reduce detection chances.

  * **Disable VPN:** Some anti-cheat systems can flag VPN usage, causing false positives. Temporarily turn it off when playing.

  * **Update Game Client:** Always ensure your Rust game client is fully updated before launching our hack.
  * **Run as Admin:** Launch `RustLoader.exe` as an administrator for proper functionality and injection.
  * **Whitelist Folder:** Add the hack's folder to your antivirus exceptions to prevent deletion or quarantine.
  * **Play Smart:** Even with advanced anti-detection, blatant or obvious use (e.g., shooting players through multiple walls, unnatural movement) can lead to manual bans from vigilant admins or player reports. Use features subtly and strategically.
  * **HWID Spoofing:** If you've been previously banned, leverage our built-in or recommended HWID spoofing features to help prevent hardware bans on new accounts.
